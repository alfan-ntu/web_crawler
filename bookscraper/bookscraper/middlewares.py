    Description: Custom functionality to process the responses that are sent to Spiders for
                 processing and to process the requests and items that are generated from
                 spiders

    Revision History:
        - 2023/12/14: v. 0.1e, modified the middlewares.py template first time to enable scrape
                              functionalities from a third party, ScrapeOps
